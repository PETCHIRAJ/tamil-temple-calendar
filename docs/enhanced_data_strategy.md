# 🚀 Enhanced Temple Calendar App Strategy
*Integrating new research findings with our validated approach*

## 📊 DATA ARCHITECTURE BREAKTHROUGH

### Three-Tier Data Model (Game Changer!)
Your research reveals a smart categorization that solves our update challenge:

| Data Type | Update Frequency | Storage Strategy | Our Coverage |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| **STATIC** | Never/Rarely | SQLite (local) | ✅ 100% scrapable |
| **YEARLY** | Annual | Pre-calculated + SQLite | ✅ 70% calculable + 30% scraped |
| **DYNAMIC** | Monthly | Optional Firebase/API | ⚠️ Nice-to-have, not MVP |

### What This Means for Solo Developer
- **MVP needs only Static + Yearly** (no server required!)
- Dynamic data can be added in v2.0
- Total data coverage jumps from 70% to **95%**

        "static": scrape_static_info(temple_name),  # Wikipedia, HR&CE
        "yearly": {
            "calculated": generate_calendar(lat, lon, 2025),
