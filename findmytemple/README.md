# FindMyTemple Data Integration

This folder contains the final tools and results from integrating FindMyTemple.com data with the HRCE temple database.

## Final Results
- **193 temples** successfully matched and enhanced with FindMyTemple data
- **67.9% coverage** of FindMyTemple temples (193/284)
- **Database enhanced** with 7 new data fields and complete JSON preservation

## Key Files

### Production Scripts
- `fixed_complete_update.py` - Final working script to update database with temple matches
- `analyze_data_quality.py` - Tool to analyze data completeness across all updated temples

### Final Results & Reports
- `FINAL_APPROVAL_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive summary of matching results and recommendations
- `temple_data_quality_report.json` - Detailed data quality analysis of all 193 temples
- `unmatched_temples.json` - 91 temples that couldn't be matched (includes 4 major temples)
- `comprehensive_temple_analysis.json` - Initial analysis of FindMyTemple data structure

## Database Changes Applied
1. **7 new columns added**: goddess, holy_water, sacred_tree, special_rituals, temple_tank, inscriptions, temple_age
2. **193 temples updated** with enhanced FindMyTemple data
3. **Complete FindMyTemple JSON preserved** in raw_data field for each temple
4. **All original HRCE data preserved**

## Data Quality Summary
- **Excellent (90-100%)**: Core identification fields (names, locations, match metadata)
- **Good (70-89%)**: Festival information (80.8% coverage)
- **Moderate (50-69%)**: Special rituals, deity info, timings
- **Needs improvement (<50%)**: Sacred elements, contact info, historical data

## Usage
To run data quality analysis on current database:
```bash
python3 analyze_data_quality.py
```

To update database with new temple matches (if needed):
```bash
python3 fixed_complete_update.py
```

## Database Backups
Multiple backups were created during the update process:
- `temples_backup_complete_*.db` - Full database backups before updates
- Located in `../database/` directory

## Project History
This integration process involved:
1. **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of FindMyTemple scraped data
2. **Matching Algorithms**: Multiple strategies for temple name matching
3. **Quality Verification**: Manual and automated verification of matches
4. **Database Updates**: Safe, reversible updates with full backups
5. **Data Quality Analysis**: Complete assessment of final data coverage

The project achieved excellent results for MVP launch with room for future enhancement.
